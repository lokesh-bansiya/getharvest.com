We were assigned with the team and we all were very new to each of us as we were interacting for the first time. At first, I thought of removing this communication gap between the team members and hence created a WhatsApp group, and we connected on zoom-call for some casual talks, and interacted with each other which is necessary to work on any project. So at the meeting itself, we set the plot of how to initiate the project and divided our parts as well.

## About Project:-
 - Individual Project
 -  Hello readers, most of you know about getharvest.com, and for those who donâ€™t know, getharvest.com, can go through this url https://www.getharvest.com/  
So we as a team were assigned to develop the clone of this website in the construct week project in Masai School. And to throw some more light, getharvest.com was our project and we managed to complete it in just 5 days, so yeah, a big cheer to the team
